Goal: write a lambda calculus parser and reducer.

Lx.((Lx.x)x) and (Lx.(Lx.x))x reduce to the same value: Lx.x

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus

Remember:

"x", a variable, is a term
"Lx.t" is a term meaning: a lambda that substutes term t for variable x (typographically!)
"t1 t2" is a term meaning: the application of t1 to t2 (invoke t1 with t2)
There are only 1-arity functions.
Parens are optional for clarity.
s t r = ((s t) r)
