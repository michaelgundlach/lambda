Goal: write a lambda calculus reducer.  So that I can show that

Lx.((Lx.x)x) and (Lx.(Lx.x))x reduce to the same value: Lx.x

Remember:

"x", a variable, is a term
"Lx.t" is a term meaning: a lambda that substutes term t for variable x (typographically!)
"t1 t2" is a term meaning: the application of t1 to t2 (invoke t1 with t2)
There are only 1-arity functions.
Parens are optional for clarity. TODO: what order if no parens?

So
Lx.((Lx.x)x) 
becomes
Lx.(x)
becomes
Lx.x

and 
(Lx.(Lx.x))x 
becomes
(   (Lx.x))
becomes
(Lx.x)
becomes
Lx.x
